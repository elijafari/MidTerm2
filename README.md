**Title**
Redesign Craiglist result page and product detail page

**About (User Story)**
The requirement for this assignment was to redesign a webpage and suggest some changes to improve UI and UX. To do so, My team member and I decided to work on Craiglist. so this is mostly HTML and CSS

**Features:**
A search box on the top of lists and filter option at the top and easy to use and access
On detail page I decided to design a slideshow at the center and other info at the bottom as I believe when customers looking for a product on a classified side they need to see product pictures and details at first

**Here is the wireframe screenshots of this assignment**
